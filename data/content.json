      "script": "Your resume is getting rejected before a human sees it? Here's why...\n\nMost companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) to filter resumes. If your resume isn't ATS-friendly, it never reaches the hiring manager.\n\nSecret 1: Use simple formatting. No tables, columns, or fancy graphics.\n\nSecret 2: Include exact keywords from the job description. The ATS scans for these.\n\nSecret 3: Use standard section headers: 'Work Experience', 'Education', 'Skills'.\n\nSecret 4: Save as .docx or .pdf, never .jpg or .png.\n\nSecret 5: Test your resume with an ATS checker online before applying.\n\nFix these 5 things and watch your response rate skyrocket!",

'Based on my research and the value I bring, I was hoping for $X. Is there flexibility?'\n\nPro tip: Always give a specific number, not a range. Ranges make you seem uncertain.\n\nAnd NEVER mention your previous salary unless legally required.\n\nUse this framework and you'll negotiate like a pro!",
