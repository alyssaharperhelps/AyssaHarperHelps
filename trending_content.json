So don\u2019t over think it, but definitely be sure to include a balance of hard + soft skills when answering this question. #careeradvice #careertiktok #job #jobinterview #jobinterviewtips #jobinterviewquestions #careercoach #personaldevelopment #professional #interviewtips #interviewtipsandtricks ",
