They are hoping that you give one number like, \u201cI am hoping to make $70k\u201d \n\u00a0\nThere is NO reason why a company should NOT tell you what the position pays and there is NO reason that they should make you tell them what you want to be paid BEFORE they tell you the range of the position. \n\u00a0\nSo don\u2019t fall for it and play the same game by answering their question with a question or giving them a non-answer. \n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcccUse this script, \n\u00a0\nInterviewer \u201cWhat are your salary expectations?\u201d \n\u00a0\nYou \u201c What is the position paying?\u201d \n\u00a0\nInterviewer \u201cWe really need to know what you want before we pass you on to the next round\u201d \n\u00a0\nYou \u201cWell, what\u2019s the range?

You dodged a bullet. \n\nTrust me, you don\u2019t want to work for a company that won\u2019t in the least disclose their salary range. \n\u00a0\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40 \n\u00a0\n#joboffernegotations #salarynegotiations #howtonegotiatesalary #careeradvice #howtonegotiatejoboffer #howtointerview #corporate #jobinterview #interviewtips #howtoanswerinterviewquestions #job #work ",

So don\u2019t over think it, but definitely be sure to include a balance of hard + soft skills when answering this question. #careeradvice #careertiktok #job #jobinterview #jobinterviewtips #jobinterviewquestions #careercoach #personaldevelopment #professional #interviewtips #interviewtipsandtricks ",
